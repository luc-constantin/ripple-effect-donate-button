## Ripple Effect button created only with HTML and CSS

##### Recently I have been looking for a ripple effect button as a default state. I have found only when clicked, and wthi no icon inside. I actyally used this
code snippet and I have spent a couple of hour in creating it due to the fact that I am no CSS wizard. Enjoy it.
